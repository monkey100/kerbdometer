DESCRIPTION

Simple little FramesPerSecond script so I can learn some KSP modding. This may turn into a profilier module, who knows, right?

Uses a modified version of the script written by Dave Hampson at the following URL:

System collections code from unknown author

The shell structure is from TacExamples at the following URL:
